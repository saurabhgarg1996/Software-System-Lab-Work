What we want to tell you:

Open Sudoku.html. Enter values in each box by clicking respective boxes in the table. Don't resize the tab and keep it in full screen view. When all values are there i.e all values are entered in box press Submit button to verify your solution. To reset sudoko press Reset button.
An alert is sent to the user telling the correctness of the answer. If the answer is not correct, the alert prompts user to try again. This might create additional dialog boxes (alerts) so you will have to close them by choosing the option to prevent such boxes. Reload/Reset the sudoku and try again.
