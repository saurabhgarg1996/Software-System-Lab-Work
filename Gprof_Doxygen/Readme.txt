Questions :

We have submitted two folders one for question 1 and the other for question 3 because changes we did in question 1 made changes in ball sequence and balls fell on ground before they go to box. Also on compilation without -O3 in debug mode its so slow that it took 15 mins for 1 ball to fall in box thus we submitted different folders for 1 and 3
(We can have done it on first question itself but changes made question 3 useless on that simulation)
Question 2 : 
 
0.17% of overall in main()
34.09% of overall in func1()
32.90% of overall in func2()
32.84% of overall in new_func1()
-pg 
Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the analysis program gprof

Question 3 :
We have three plots two in debug mode and one in release mode .
In debug mode one is before optimazation and other is after optimization.
Thus we have three log file i.e txt files in doc folder.

-O3 is for optimization
-g is not needed in release mode because the gcc -g flag tells gcc to generate and embed debug information which is not needed
