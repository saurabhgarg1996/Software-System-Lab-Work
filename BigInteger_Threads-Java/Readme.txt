What we want to tell you:  -------------
Q1. For part b we have printed all  4 answers separated by , 

Q2.  	In this question we are submitting two versions of the code for Q2(a) and for Q2(b). Q2(a) contains synchronized blocks inside the Reader and Writer classes itself. For Q2(b) The book class has been modified to have functions read() and write() which take in parameters of the type Reader and Writer respectively and check he version read untill now and also whether the writer is there on the book or not (using boolean writerthere) and prints the statements which were asked respectively. Similarly, when write function is invoked by writer, the count of readers currently reading the book is checked, boolean variable writerthere is updated and the statements that need to be printed are printed. Finally there is a method geti() which returns the i value of a Book.

As we could not do the Q2(b) using snychronized blocks in Reader and Writer classes, so we had to change the Book.java file for 2(b).
