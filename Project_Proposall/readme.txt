What we want to tell you :

Problem 1 :

Input to the terminal should be given in octave friendly manner. This input function should have local maxima else code never ends. Also the input function should keep z in small ranges so that it doesnot go out of bounds as alpha then needs to be very small. Now as we cannot change according to user input alpha at present is set at 0.001 . {Works upto (x^4+y^4)}
This is implemented using a creation of input.dat file which plots the function in gnuplot file and deleted once after plot.png is created. 


Inlab instructions :
Problem 1 : final.txt file contains everything needed to generate boxPlot using plot.sh. Also all other generated files are included in submitted folder.
