Question 1(k):

Neither push nor pull happens initially. While pulling initially we faced a merge conflict on Automerge, and hence we had to add it again and commit it again (it refers to
observeConflict.txt) and then we could push and pull between first and remoterepo easily. 

The log file is in the folder

It includes 4 commits, the three stated in the question and the one commit used for resolving merge conflict.


Question 2:
the python script fetch_data.py is run as : python3 fetch_data.py <filename> where filename is the argument : marks.csv here. The outputs to the questions 2(a), b, c, d and e are printed in order on the terminal. For (e) a new csv file is created as directed in the question.

Question 3:
While running please ensure that tenth.txt is in the same directory as the py script.
