Answer to Q.1 ---------------------------------------
The error was that the JPanel variable controlPanel had not been initialised, that is it was not allocated memory using new (no Constructor was called). So we commented out that line and the code was working fine.

The output is that a Box pops up at the top left corner of the screen and in it is written the line "I am a basic GUI".
