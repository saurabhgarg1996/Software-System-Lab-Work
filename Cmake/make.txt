(a) We are working with Box2D project in cs251_base folder
(b) After studying Makefile.orig we came to know how a Makefile is written. 
(c) In standard UNIX system Makefile and makefile do the same thing. But when both are present makefile is at higher priority then Makefile 	and thus makefile is executed.
(d) Target dirs created two folders mybins and myobjs if they were not present else there was no effect.
(e) Target b2dsetup automatically installs Box2D if there was no Box2D file in external/include. We followed instructions given in 	       	   cs251_README.txt .
(f) This task was collectively completed in previous mentioned tasks.
(g) The cpp files were compiled and their respective object files were placed to myobjs folder.
(h) Object files were linked to library files and then converted to executables.
(i) We have used two targets one for objects and other one for executables. We have not included it in make all thus by default non-optimised 	  one will run.  
(j) Target clean removes object files and executables from myobjs and mybins.
(k) Target distclean removes files from external/include and external/lib and Box2D from external/src/.
(l) Target makesubmission creates lab05_g14.tar.gz file which contains src and makefile.
